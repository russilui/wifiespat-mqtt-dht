# wifiespat-mqtt-dht

## Arduino UNO WiFi Dev. Ed. simple DHT sensor data MQTT sender

  This example connects to a local MQTT broker and publishes a message to
  a topic once a second. It makes use of UnoWiFiDevEdSerial1 and 
  WiFiEspAT with persistent WiFi settings to send DHT sensor 
  readings to the MQTT broker using Arduino MQTT library.
  
  The circuit:
  - Uno WiFi Dev Ed board
  - DHT22 (AM2302)
